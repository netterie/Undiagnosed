Project Goal
========================================================

**To use CD4 data to _increase the precision_ of undiagnosed estimates from the testing history model** 

*Why* 
- Negative tests that are many years prior to diagnosis, i.e. "long infection windows", are not very informative regarding time of infection
- CD4 at diagnosis can indicate recency of infection

*How*
- From literature, identify typical times to infection for various CD4 counts
- Use this to update the probability of infection within long infection windows

*Impact in WA*
- Our pre-analysis of CD4 measurements in WA indicates that using CD4 will increase the precision of our undiagnosed estimates but will not significantly change the estimated number of undiagnosed cases
- The main impact of integrating CD4 will be to increase our confidence in the estimates 

Reminder: the testing history method
========================================================
type:sub-section

Base Case distributes probability uniformly across the infection window
========================================================


<center>
_The hazard (instantaneous rate) of infection at any point within the window is 1/(window length), shown by the red line for two different window lengths. Time=0 refers to time of diagnosis._ 
<img src="figure/minimal-unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-1" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-1" width="1500px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
</center>

The red line is lower when the window is longer, since the probability of infection is spread out over a longer time period.

Longer windows have less probability assigned to the recent period
========================================================
<center>
_Cumulative probability of diagnosis is the area under the curve. At 1 year prior to diagnosis, for example, the 2-year window assigns greater probability of infection than the 4-year window._ 
<img src="figure/minimal-unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2" width="1500px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
</center>

Since 1 year is 1/2 of 2 years, 50% of infection probability occurs within 1 year for the 2-year window. In contrast, only 1/5 or 20% of infection probability occurs within 1 year for the 5-year window.

Never-tester assumption gives a window of age-16 or 18 years
========================================================

**For never-testers, we assume a window of 18 years or age-16, whichever is smaller.**

<center>
_Example of windows for never-testers of different ages_
<img src="figure/minimal-unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3" width="1500px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
</center>

The age distribution of never-testers thus influences what window lengths they contribute to the population TID (time from infection to diagnosis).

Reminder: testing histories in WA, 2005-2014
========================================================
type:sub-section

59% of cases have testing history (2005-2014)
========================================================

**Testing histories = Tested + Never Tested**

Total N=5148 <br>

</center>

MSM comprise about 2/3 of cases.<br>
What is driving differential response rates?

Half of all windows are 2 years or shorter
========================================================


<center>
_Distribution of infection window lengths in years (N=3016). Labels indicate bounds, e.g. (0,1] includes windows>0 and <=1. The 18-year windows imputed because of the assumption for never-testers are labeled as 18 (NT)._
<img src="figure/minimal-wd-1.png" title="plot of chunk wd" alt="plot of chunk wd" width="1920px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
</center>

50% have windows between 0 and 2 years (red plus gold).

About 1/3 of all windows are 5 years or longer

Our assumption for never-testers almost doubles the number of windows >=5 years (blue plus purple).

Median window length for MSM is around 1 year, versus 5 years for non-MSM

</center>

58% of non-MSM have windows 5 years or longer. The 18-year assumption for never-testers is almost 4x more common among non-MSM (31%) than among MSM (7%).

More concurrent dx among non-MSM contribute to their longer windows

Older never-testers among non-MSM also contribute to longer windows

</center>

Mean age at diagnosis among never-testers is 42 in non-MSM, versus 36 in MSM <br>
Remember the assumption for never-testers: window=min(age-16,18). Cases older than 16+18=34 will all have 18-year windows.

In WA, non-MSM are where precision can be increased
========================================================
**Whether it's using BED, CD4, or concurrent AIDS dx, etc**
- Short testing intervals in MSM = low uncertainty regarding time of infection

**Increasing precision will not necessarily decrease undiagnosed estimates**
- More precise estimates will deviate from the Base Case inasmuch as the additional information changes the probability of infection within the window

**Total population estimates will not change greatly, but our confidence in them will increase**
- non-MSM are only 1/3 of the population
- But if cases with long windows tested due to risky exposure, CD4 should help pick up on that

Methods: integrating CD4 into the testing history method
========================================================
type: sub-section

Under Base Case, long windows = low probability of recent infection
========================================================

**CD4 Unknown**

Window Length | If CD4 unknown, infection probability is mostly:
---- | ----------------------------------
Short  | Recent  
Long  | Non-recent  

Long window but high CD4 indicates a higher likelihood of recent infection
========================================================

**CD4 Unknown**

Window Length | If CD4 unknown, infection probability is mostly:
---- | ----------------------------------
Short  | Recent  
Long  | Non-recent  

**CD4 Known**

Window Length | If CD4 unknown, infection probability is mostly: | CD4=Low | CD4=High
---- | ---------------------------------- | ----------| -------------------
Short | Recent | Recent (fast progressor?) | Recent
Long  | Non-recent  | Non-recent | **Recent**

**Those with long windows but high CD4 may be unrecognized recent infections**
<br>

Median times to CD4 from the literature
========================================================


**Years it takes for 50% of cases to reach CD4 level:**

CD4 Category | Lodi 2011 | Cori 2015 | Our approximation^* 
-------------|:------------:|:-------:|:--------:
>500 | 1.3 | 2.3 | 1.5
350-500 | 4.3 | 4.2 | 4.0
200-350 | 7.9 | 8.0 | 8.0
0-200 | | 11.5 | 9.0 

<p style="font-size:30px">
* Simplified median times that are consistent with both sources. For CD4 0-200, we will retain our maximum-window assumption of 18 years. This sets a maximum median time of 9 years
</p>

**Interpretation**: 50% of infection probability should occur within the median time. <br><br>
**Implication**: If a case has CD4>500 at diagnosis, for example, we expect 50% of his infection probability to occur in the 1.5 years prior to dx

Strategy: re-allocate infection probability given CD4 at diagnosis
========================================================

**Base Case**: 50% infection probability is in each half of the window

<center>
_In the example of a window of 18 years, 50% probability of infection is spread across years 0-9 prior to dx_
<img src="figure/minimal-unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-8" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-8" width="1920px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
</center>

Strategy: re-allocate infection probability given CD4 at diagnosis
========================================================

**CD4 Case**: 50% of infection probability is shifted into the CD4-based median window

<center>
_For a window of 18 years and various CD4 bins at diagnosis, the graphs show the Base Case (red) versus CD4 Case (blue) distribution of the probability of infection within the window. Shading indicates the new placement of 50% of infection probability._
<img src="figure/minimal-unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-9" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-9" width="1920px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
</center>


Impact will come from high CD4s in people with "long" windows
========================================================

CD4 Category | CD4 Median | Impacts windows longer than 
-------------| :---------: | :---------:
>500 | 1.5 | 3.0
350-500 | 4.0 | 8.0
200-350 | 8.0 | 16.0

**Degree of impact will depend on how much longer windows are than 2x the CD4-based median** 
* 18-year windows among individuals with CD4>500 will provide much greater impact than 4-year windows, for example
* Even 18-year windows will have minimal impact among CD4 200-350, since the Base Case median for 18-year windows is 9 years and the CD4-based median is 8 years (not much difference)

* Never testers get a window length of min(age-16, 18 years). <br>
* Low CD4 and long windows both imply low probability of recent infection

Conclusions, limitations and possibilities
========================================================
type: sub-section

CD4 data indicate that most WA cases with long windows were not recently infected
========================================================

Window Length | If CD4 unknown, infection probability is mostly: | CD4=Low | CD4=High
---- | ---------------------------------- | ----------| -------------------
Short | Recent | Recent (fast progressor?) | Recent
Long  | Non-recent  | Non-recent | **Recent**


In WA, only 10% of cases with testing history had infection windows that indicated less probability of recent infection than indicated by their CD4 count

CD4 Case did not impact subgroups differentially
========================================================

**We expected to see greater impact in non-MSM than MSM**
* non-MSM did have a higher fraction of cases impacted (17% for non-MSM versus 7% for MSM)
* But among the impacted cases, the MSM had larger decreases in their median infection points (50th percentiles: 1.94 years for non-MSM versus 2.34 years for MSM) 
* This translated into slightly higher impacts on mean TID and mean undiagnosed estimates for MSM


Limitations
========================================================

**We prioritize testing history data**
* If testing history indicates more recent infection than CD4 does, we use the testing history
* Little is known about the accuracy of self-reports of the last negative test before diagnosis

**We use CD4 conservatively**
* Literature on CD4 trajectories is fairly sparse
* Data indicate plenty of heterogeneity, hence the need for using a fairly conservative approach for the CD4 Case
 
Future work
========================================================

**CD4 in cases with missing testing history**
* Use CD4 to examine the "missing at random" assumption among cases with missing testing history

**Multiple markers**
* Use a Bayesian approach to combine information from BED, CD4 and concurrent diagnoses
